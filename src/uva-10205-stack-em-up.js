// The Big City has many casinos. In one of them, the dealer cheats. She has perfected
// several shuffles; each shuffle rearranges the cards in exactly the same way whenever
// it is used. A simple example is the "bottom card" shuffle, which removes the bottom
// card and places it at the top. By using various combinations of these known shuffles,
// the crooked dealer can arrange to stack the cards in just about any particular order.
//
// You have been retained by the security manager to track this dealer. You are given a
// list of all the shuffles performed by the dealer, along with visual cues that allow
// you to determine which shuffle she uses at any particular time. Your job is to
// predict the order of the cards after a sequence of shuffles.
//
// A standard playing card deck contains 52 cards, with 13 values in each of four
// suites. The values are named, _2_, _3_, _4_, _5_, _6_, _7_, _8_, _9_, _10_, _Jack_,
// _Queen_, _King_, _Ace_. The suites are named _Clubs_, _Diamonds_, _Hearts_, _Spades_.
// A particular card in the deck can be uniquely identified by its value and suite,
// typically denoted <_value_> of <_suite_>. For example "9 of hearts" or "King of
// Spades." Traditionally a new deck is ordered first alphabetically by suit, then by
// value in the order given above.
//
// ## Input
// The number of shuffles that the dealer knows is $n \leq 100$. The first parameter is
// an array of integers between 1 and $n$. Each integer $k$ indicates that you have
// observed the dealer applying the $k$th shuffle. The second parameter is an array of
// $n$ sets of 52 integers. Each comprises all the integers from 1 to 52 in some order.
// Within each set of 52 integers, $i$ in position $j$ means that the shuffle moves the
// $i$ths card in the deck to position $j$.
//
// ## Output
// Assume the dealer starts with a new deck ordered as descried above. After all the
// shuffles had been performed, give the names of the cards in the deck, in the new
// order.
